**Attendance Update App**
This app allows you to update users' attendance by uploading a user data file.

**File Requirements**
1. The file must be in .CSV format (Comma-Separated Values).
2. The .CSV file must have the following columns in exactly this order:

ID, User Login, User Pass, User Nicename, User Email, User Url, User Registered, User Activation Key, User Status, Display Name

Make sure your CSV file includes these headers exactly as above, to ensure proper parsing and updating of attendance data.
